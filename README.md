# Community Space Game
 A community-driven FTL esque game focused on modability and customization.

Large notice I've forgotten until now: This project would not be in it's current state without the exceptional help of Ashley Davies-Lyons and their Easy GUI Library, which has allowed for very fast prototyping and testing in ways that would not have been possible if I had begun work with a more complicated Library.
